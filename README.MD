The above code pertains to the flask server deployed in Heroku:

*   Connectivity to Google dialogflow is implemented in index.py
    *   The webhook() function handles a call from dialogflow, to fetch result from a symptom.

*   Connectivity to Healthcare is implemented in getreply.py which handles the call from dialogflow
    *   Has a function getreply() which takes a specific symptom and scrapes healthline for its results and returns them to index.py as a reply message.


### Getting started

*   Please use the following tutorial https://pybit.es/deploy-flask-heroku.html to deploy the flask server to heroku
*   The Heroku server needs two environment variable GOOGAUTH to be able to access Google Dialogflow and Googlemaps api. The GOOGAUTH is a string that is the base64 encoding of the contents of the service account credentials json file that is obtained as shown here https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth. Here is the documentation to set these variables in heroku https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars.
*   You can import the Google Dialogflow project provided here /dialogflow/Procurai.zip and import it into a newly created agent in Google Dialogflow.
*   Please use this documentation to integrate Google Dialog flow with Twilio https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/twilio
*   Use the file located in entityscraper/Procurai_CreateEntities.ipynb to generate the list of key words for the symptom entity in dialogflow by scraping symptoms from healthline.
